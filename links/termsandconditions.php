            <br>
            <h2><em>Please read this information carefully as it contains important details about your rights and obligations as well as limitations and exclusions that may apply to you.</em></h2>
            <br>
            <p>We strive to fulfill every order according to your precise specifications. However, since our natural hair is derived from individual donors and is 100% virgin human hair, we cannot ensure consistent hair color or texture. Our natural hair is obtainable in straight, wavy, or curly patterns and is typically available in natural shades of 1b and 2. On occasion, we may have naturally lighter pieces accessible upon request, but their availability cannot be guaranteed. Please take note that if you are unhappy with the color or texture of your purchase, we will exchange it one time only. You can return the hair using the provided label, and we will do our best to fulfill your request with our current inventory. If you are still dissatisfied with your purchase's color or texture, you will be responsible for any future returns.</p>
            <br>
